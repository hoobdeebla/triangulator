# triangulator
Inscribing circles and midpoints! Oh my!

This project, co-authored by [@matttt](https://github.com/matttt) and myself, was based off of concepts from our high school geometry class. We brainstormed together; he implemented the math formulas in JS and the initial layout, then I made a few small design changes. Full credit where credit is due.
